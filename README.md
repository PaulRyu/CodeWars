# CodeWars Kata - Paul Ryu
### This is a personal repository for my attempts at CodeWars problems.

The repository is organized into the different languages used to implement the solutions for given problems and also organizes problems into their respective Kyu, or difficulty level, folders.

The smaller the Kyu -> the more difficult the problem.
For example, 8 Kyu is the easiest. 1 Kyu is the hardest.
